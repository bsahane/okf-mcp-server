"""Retrieval evaluation: Hit@k over an agreed question set.

Question file (YAML)::

    questions:
      - question: What is the hotel limit in London?
        expected: [policies/travel-policy]   # concept IDs holding the evidence
      - question: What reward does the model use?
        expected: [papers/r1#2-2-reward-design, papers/r1#3-1-model-based-rewards]
      - question: Who approves exceptions to the parking rule?
        expected: []                          # no answer in the corpus

An expected entry is a concept ID, or `concept#section` to require that exact
section (section slugs are listed by `get_knowledge`). Hit@k is the fraction
of answerable questions with at least one expected entry in the top k
results; `all_found` reports whether every entry was retrieved, and `rank` is
the position of the first match (for MRR).
